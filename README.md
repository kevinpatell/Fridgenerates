# Fridgenerate

You get home after a long day at work. You're starving. You can't think straight. You have all these ingredients, but no idea what to make. Why don't we do the thinking for you? Fridgenerate is an interactive web application that allows users to input ingredients and are provided a list of recipes based on their input.

## Technical Aspects

-Front-end: REACT for ease of creation with components and enhancing UX
-Back-end: Python/Django
-REST framework: to organize and create custom endpoints for user integration and ingredient data storage
-Spoontacular API: a recipe API with data on over 300k recipes.
-Search Functionality: using a dataset of ingredients to cross reference the "Search-by-Ingredient" endpoint of Spoontacular API
-Stretch Goal: User Functionality to save recipes and ingredient lists
